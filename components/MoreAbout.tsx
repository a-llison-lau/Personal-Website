        I love solving problems and I seek to learn as broadly as possible â€” not
        just to master a subject, but to uncover new ways of seeing. I am an
        explorer at heart, driven by a curiosity to understand the world,
        humans, intelligent systems, and the relationship between the artificial
        and the natural. My work spans diverse research domains, including
        causal effect estimation and systems security in LLMs, computational
        sensing, and interdisciplinary science and instrumentation. I believe
        that computation should serve not just optimization, but meaning.
